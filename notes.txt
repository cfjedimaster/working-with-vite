adds ESM support - no bundling
	good definitions: https://irian.to/blogs/what-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-in-javascript/
fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
adds TS, JSX, CSS(?) 


Like Vue CLI, provides scaffolding
But not based on webpack, uses Rollup for build

faster, ie 10x
not doing server side bundling, uses browser's ability to work with modules, no babel (https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import)

for production, must support this: https://caniuse.com/es6-module
Chrome >=61
Firefox >=60
Safari >=11
Edge >=16

old - parses every single file, so bigger project == more time
new, browser+ESM loads what it needs to do at first, as you use app, more is loaded
vite does some work to keep http requests in check

HMR over ESM was an issue, not supported natively, Vite fixes it

s
not a replacement

npm i 

getting started:
npm init @vitejs/app
OR
npm init @vitejs/app projectName -- --template vue
